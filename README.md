Text Adventure for Python 2.7

A simple, work-in-progress, free and open source text adventure for beginners and hobbyists.

Last update 1/1/2017:
- Added save/load game functionality
- Added functionality for drop
- Cleaned up code a bit


To do:
- Keep text for rooms, descriptions, commands, etc. in a separate file (JSON, YAML, etc.)
- Add states and actions to rooms, e.g. open/close window
- Pretty print for room items and inventory
- "look keys, wallet" --> "Your wallet is empty.". Assume user error, or add check?
- Add support for multiple item drop?
